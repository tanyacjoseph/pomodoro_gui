This is a GUI that allows users to utilize the pomodoro technique.
The pomodoro technique is a time management system that breaks working into different sections.
After 25 minutes of work, there is a 5 minute break, for a total of a 30 minute session.
After 4 of these 30 minute sessions, there is a longer 20 minute break.

When pressing start, the interface will automatically go through the cycles following the times above
and will make a sound and have the window popup at the beginning of each cycle.

Run the main.py file to get started.
